This project was created by Ken

I started by reading the Mozilla Web Docs
Then I followed the Creating a React App

## Create React App Link
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_components

Attempted this, which I found very tricky because Im not used to following documentation. I learnt that reading step by step every instruction is way more important than skipping steps because the documentation is written in a way to force you to think and figure things out whenever challenges arise.

## Todo Article 1

## Todo Article 2
I got really stuck at the step titled 'Rendering with Iteration' I felt like the documentation didnt outline where to perform the steps

Was unsure if it was in the App.js, index.js or components/Todo.js or elsewhere

## Fun Stuff
As always I decided to put my creative flare on the app by slightly altering the Css to have rounded corners and add relevant colours

Green was chosen because it strikes the same colour as the traffic light, insinuation the word Go. This is an action you perform when using a ticklist. Added blue gradient to make it contrast but also not too warm, because blue indicates a pending or waiting status

Below are the tools I used to express this

# Summary
I initially found React daunting and NPM Start very tricky, then with the personal drive and mental coaching of a peer they motivated me to give it one last crack... Im very happy I did
